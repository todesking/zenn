# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Zenn content repository for publishing technical articles and books on the Japanese technical publishing platform Zenn (zenn.dev). The repository uses `zenn-cli` to manage and preview content locally.

## Common Commands

### Content Management
- `npx zenn preview` - Start local preview server (opens browser at http://localhost:8000)
- `npx zenn new:article` - Create a new article with auto-generated slug
- `npx zenn new:article --slug my-article-slug` - Create article with custom slug
- `npx zenn new:book` - Create a new book
- `npx zenn list:articles` - List all articles
- `npx zenn list:books` - List all books

### Development Workflow
1. Create new content using the commands above
2. Edit markdown files in `/articles/` or `/books/`
3. Preview changes with `npx zenn preview`
4. Commit changes when satisfied
5. Push to GitHub to automatically publish on Zenn

## Repository Structure

- `/articles/` - Individual technical articles in markdown format
  - Each article has YAML frontmatter with metadata (title, emoji, type, topics, published)
